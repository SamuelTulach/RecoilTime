## How to use
Before using this program please check if the game you want to use it in does not detect programs that are using mouse_event as cheats.

 1. Download or compile the program

 2. Set your options so it fits the game and your mouse sensitivity
 3. Use insert key to activate/deactivate recoil control
 4. Spray every little shit from 5km in PUBG
